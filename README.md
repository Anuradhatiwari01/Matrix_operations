# Matrix Operations Web App

## What this project does
This is a simple web application that allows users to perform basic
matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

Users can create matrices of different sizes, enter values, and
see the result directly on the screen.

## Why I built this
While learning matrices in mathematics and programming, I wanted
to understand how matrix operations work step by step.

This project helped me practice JavaScript logic and connect it
with a simple web interface.

## Main features
- Create matrices of different sizes
- Perform matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication
- Checks whether matrix sizes are valid for an operation
- Shows results in a clear table format
- Simple and responsive user interface

## How the system works
The user selects the size of two matrices and enters their values.
JavaScript reads the inputs, performs the selected matrix operation,
and displays the result below the input matrices.

## Tech used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Project structure
- `index.html` – Page structure
- `styles.css` – Styling and layout
- `script.js` – Matrix logic and calculations

## How to run
Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.

## What I learned
- How matrix operations work programmatically
- How to take dynamic input from users
- How to separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Writing clear logic in JavaScript

## Future improvements
- Add more matrix operations
- Improve input handling
- Add step-by-step calculation view
